#   **What was my experience:**
  
  -  First of all, for starting this project, I created all of  the necessary files such as, index.html, which is responsible for the html, index.scss, which is responsible for the styles and index.js which is responsible for the functionality. 

  - Secondly, I fetched the data from the given API as you can see in App.js file in order to display all of the weather details.

#   **In a few sentences, explain the structure of my project:**
  - First and foremost, apart from index.hmtl, index.scss, index.js, I have few components in which I structure all of my code in order to do this project.

  - In the App.js in where you can see I fetch the data from the given API with normal fetch, and I passed the data into the `Search` and `ShowingLists` files so that I can access and use them in these files. To be honest, I still did use `UseContext` and `UseReducer` yet as I still fixing some stuff.

  - I have the search in which you click to get the from, the form which you use to search for a city. When you click the search button inside of the form, you close the toggle popup and can see the name of the city in which you need to click to generate all weather details about that city.

  - Besides, the showingLists is devided into two parts, lists of the future weather for five days is the first part and some details from the actual weather is the second.

#  **If I had more time, I would you improve:**
  - First, I would like to use UseContext and UseReducer.

  - I would improve the naming thing to make them undertandable and expressive.

  - Also, I would cleanse my code very well so that it's easy for others to understand it.

#   **New I learned while working on this project:**

  

# **What was the most challenging part for you**
  - According to what I encountered while working on this project, to 
  <!-- handle the search and the input form is the most challenging. On top of that, I had no idea of how to create the pagination in order to show ten lists of jobs for each page. I could not complete the coumpound component because I knew that I would not have enough time for it so I'd rather trying to deal with the filtering instead.
